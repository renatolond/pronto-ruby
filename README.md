# Secrets

A GitHub token is available by default when using actions, but you must include it in the `env` map for this Action to use when creating a check run.

Be sure to include the ENV variable in your job step:

```yaml
    - uses: renatolond/pronto-ruby
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

That's it!

# Configuration

Pronto can be configured via the `.pronto.yml` configuration file in your repo.

# Example

With the defaults (only rubocop):

```yaml
name: Pronto

on:
  - pull_request

jobs:
  run:
    permissions:
      checks: write
      contents: read
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }} # checkout HEAD commit instead of merge commit
          fetch-depth: 50 # If your repository has long-living PRs, this might need to be higher
      - run: git fetch origin main
      - uses: renatolond/pronto-ruby@v4.4-r
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          target: origin/main
